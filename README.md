# Welcome to my page!  

This is a project I am using to learn programming. It is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with elements named according to the BEM convention. The project includes basic, commonly used website elements (e.g., sections, header, navigation, images, OpenGraph, tables, buttons) and their formatting (e.g., background color, text color, bold, italic, borders). I invite you to check out my project:
